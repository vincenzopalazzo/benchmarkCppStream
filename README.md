## The benchmark is disponible [here](https://vincenzopalazzo.github.io/benchmarkCppStream/)

The benchmark is for the C++/C stream with compression data and without compression data with [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/) library.

Disable the benchmark_ofstream_zlib to look well on the chart because the benchmark_ofstream_zlib is bigger than the others.
